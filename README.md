## Algorithms

### Dijkstra Algorithm

- The Dijkstra algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
- Implementation details and logic behind the C implementation.
- Examples of using the Dijkstra algorithm.

### Parallel Dijkstra Algorithm

- A parallel implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for improved performance.
- Dependencies or libraries required for parallelization.
- Examples and benefits of parallel Dijkstra.

### Kruskal Algorithm

- The Kruskal algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree in a graph.
- Implementation details and logic behind the C implementation.
- Examples of using the Kruskal algorithm.

### Prim Algorithm

- The Prim algorithm also finds the minimum spanning tree in a graph.
- Implementation details and logic behind the C implementation.
- Examples of using the Prim algorithm.

## Dynamic Fibonacci Series

- Introduction to the concept of a dynamic Fibonacci series.
- Advantages and use cases for a dynamic Fibonacci series.
- Implementation details of the dynamic Fibonacci series algorithm.

## Compilation

Compile the code using "make" command. Make sure you have make installed if you're not on a linux system.
You also need an updated C compiler which supports OpemMP directives

## Usage

The application interface is very explicit. You'll just have to follow the steps and provide necessary data
